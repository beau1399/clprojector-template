# clprojector-proj

CLPROJECTOR is a Leiningen template for Web projects that use browser scripting to do 3 dimensional rendering. It provides functions to translate, rotate, and project 3D coordinates onto the 2D raster graphics interface offered by the browser. There are also functions to draw lines and polygons from 3D coordinates, and to output text and raster images to the display.
